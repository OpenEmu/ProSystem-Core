ProSystem JG
------------
ProSystem JG is an emulator for the Atari 7800.

This is a fork of ProSystem 1.3e with patches from OpenEmu, which contains
patches derived from Wii7800 and js7800.

The code has been significantly altered. It was ported from C++ to C, and
all of the dependencies and Windows-specific code were removed.

This repository lives at https://gitlab.com/jgemu/prosystem

Compiling
---------
Make sure you have The Jolly Good API's header files installed. If you did
not install them, you will be required to include their path in CFLAGS.

Linux:
  make

macOS:
  make

BSD:
  gmake

Windows (MSYS2):
  make

The build will be output to "prosystem/". This directory may be used as is
locally by copying it to your local "cores" directory, or may be installed
system-wide using the "install" target specified in the Makefile.

Input Devices
-------------
ProSystem JG uses a game database to determine which input devices must be
plugged in. The following input devices are currently supported:

7800 Joystick
XG-1 Light Gun
